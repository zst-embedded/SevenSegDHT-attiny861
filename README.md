# SevenSegDHT-attiny861

## Description
### A project involving the DHT11 humdity-temperature sensor and 7-segment displays. 
### This is also my first time trying out C++ OOP, coming from a Java OOP and Embedded C background. 

## 7-segments used
### I used leftover 7-segment displays. One of which is a single digit common cathode, and the other is a dual digit common anode. PWM was used to control the brightness via the common pin. PWM modes (clear on compare, and set on compare) were used to control the different logic levels.
